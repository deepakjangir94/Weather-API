# Weather-API

In this project, We created an weather API to display the weather data of any particular city around the world. 

Weather API
1. Used HTML to structure the webpage.
2. Used CSS to design the webpage.
3. Used JavaScript to add the functionality for search the weather report for a particular city.
4. Used API key of OpenWeather webpage to collect the weather data of cities.
5. Manipulate the json web response into our desired display format.

By the way, in images folder I am only able to upload clear.jpg image. You can use your own images or you can download the same one from this drive link.

One more important thing that I used my own API key to access the OpenWeather webpage to collect the data. If the same API key is routed in two different computers then It will not work. So, I recommand you to create an account and sign in at OpenWeather and generate your own api key.

OpenWeather website: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in

After sign in, click on API Keys on navigation bar and copy-paste it in your app.js file in line 4.
